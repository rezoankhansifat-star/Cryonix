        As mentioned above, the housing unit consists of 3 modules: Housing Module, Laboratory and Transition Module.<br />The
        Laboratory and Housing module, are, outwardly, equal, only differ in the arrangement of the partition walls.
        Each of these modules consists of a cylinder with 14 meters in diameter and 2 meters high. On top of this
        cylinder is a spherical dome with a maximum height of 6 meters. The displacement module is only a cylinder with
        a radius of 2.4 meters, cut and lying down, which joins the laboratory module with the housing module.

      <p class="the-goal-of-building">
        The goal of building a structure on Mars is to create a shelter for a team of 4 . The housing unit needs to
        ensure the safety of the team facing the Mars adversities and to ensure that the mental health of astronauts is
        not compromised. For this purpose, the design of the housing unit on Mars will consist of 3 elements with
        different objectives and will be built using mainly technology associated with 3D printing:<br />* Laboratory and
        Work Module;<br />* Transition Module - House - Work;<br />* Housing Module - Leisure.<br /> <br />To ensure an
        acceptable thermal behavior for the housing module, some thickness values of this module were limited to a
        minimum value. The recommended thermal comfort characteristics were accepted as recommended average values in
        Europe. Assuming that, in addition to the thickness of 3cm of polyethylene, a thermal insulation layer of basalt
        fiber of 3.5 cm will also be placed, it is possible to calculate the minimum thickness of the moisture ABS and
        Basalt Fiber.
      </p>
      <p class="color-the-structural">
        Color<br />The structural component of the house will be composed by a mix of composite ABS (colorless) polymer
        and basalt fibers.  That means that, seen from the outside, the housing module will have a color according to
        the image below.

      <p class="mechanical-behavior">
        Mechanical behavior of the housing module<br />By applying the total loads from the pressure difference in the
        walls, which separate the interior of the housing and the exterior, we were able to simulate the behavior of the
        structure on Mars, with the design and materials selected. In the images, it is represented the stress values on
        the materials.

      <p class="the-sizes-of-the">
        The sizes of the compartments within the Lunar Surface Habitat (SH) are defined by the required habitability
        functions, using the recommended minimal volume and dimensions for those functions as a basis for the internal
        layout. The resulting areas and volumes in the final layout generally tend to be larger than the recommended
        minimums.<br />The overall Surface Habitat layout is designed for two crewmembers for 30 days, and includes
        three internal levels. The total habitable volume in the layout is significantly larger than the recommended
        minimum.<br />Overall Habitat and Level Dimensions<br />The standard height for most volumes is 2.4 meters,
        excluding the Sleep Accommodation, Temporary EVA Items Stowage, and Airlock Functions.

      <p class="the-habitat-is">
        The habitat is divided into three levels with specific floor heights and areas:<br />• Level 1 (Airlock, Work
        Surface, EVA Computer, ECLSS):<br />    ◦ Area: 33.2 m².<br />    ◦ Floor Height: 2.5 m.<br />• Level 2
        (Hygiene, UWMS, Exercise, Utilization, ECLSS):<br />    ◦ Area: 17.2 m².<br />    ◦ Floor Height: 2.5 m.<br />•
        Level 3 (Crew Quarters, Galley, Ward Table, Utilization, Storage, ECLSS):<br />    ◦ Area: 15.2 m².<br />    ◦
        Floor Height: 2.6 m.<br />Crew Translation Paths are standardized at 1.00m wide.<br />Combined Functional Space
        Sizes<br />The layout assessed the dimensions of combined functional spaces, often exceeding the minimum
        recommendations:
